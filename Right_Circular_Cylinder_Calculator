# Program to calculate the volume of a right circular cylinder

# Importing math library
import math

# Taking the radius and height of the cylinder as input from the user
radius = float(input("Enter radius of the cylinder ( cm): "))
height = float(input("Enter height of the cylinder ( cm): "))

# Calculating the volume of the cylinder using the formula given
volume = math.pi * radius * radius * height

# Printing the result
print("\nVolume of the Cylinder =", volume, "cubic centimeter")

# Process and Calculations:
# Formula used: Volume of Circular Cylinder = (πr2) × Height
# Taking input from the user for radius and height of the cylinder
# Calculating the volume of the cylinder using the formula 'Volume of Circular Cylinder = (πr2) × Height'
# Printing the result

# Details:
# Radius of the Cylinder: _____ cm
# Height of the Cylinder: _____ cm
# Volume of the Cylinder: _____ cubic centimeter
